<h1>Predicting the amount of food swallowed during Aplysia californica feeding from neural recordings

 ### [5 Minute Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo0Ssb4slkw)

<h2>Description</h2>
Thanks to our extensive knowledge of Aplysia californica's neurons and muscles, it is currently possible to make great qualitative predictions of its feeding behavior. Just by looking at its neural firing patterns, we can know whether it is going to bite, swallow, or reject food. However, it is currently not possible to make quantitative predictions of these behaviors. For example, by looking at the neural activity, we can tell the animal is going to swallow food, but we don't know how much food it will swallow. The goal of this project is to create a model capable of making these quantitative predictions. We aim to predict the amount of food swallowed during _Aplysia californica_ feeding from neural recordings.
